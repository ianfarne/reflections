When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When working with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    To ensure that individual work is ready for the public.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks: Allows one to copy another users GitHub repository into another
    GitHub repository.
    Clones: Allows one to copy a GitHub repository into a local repository.
    Branches: Allows one to copy a local repository into a new local repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It can allow the user to compare their branch with the remote branch while
    off-line.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Carrier pigeon.
    Easier: ???
    Harder: Probably everything about pigeon ownership.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    It would allow you to run tests on the separate branch while not affecting
    the master branch.
